        <p>It was a dark and stormy night...<br>
           the rain slammed against the window <br>
           then a car came up the drive...<br>
           it was my good buddy with a bottle of whiskey<br>
           but I sent him back to town because he forgot the pizza!<br>
           Shortly after I texted him to say never mind coming back.  He was too late my wife came home!<br>
           The End.
